## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional)
- Redis (for caching, optional)
- PostgreSQL (for data storage, optional)
- API keys:
  - ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY (https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)
  - NEWS_API_KEY (https://newsapi.org)
  - FMP_API_KEY (https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/moneybot.git
cd moneybot
```

2. Create virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Core dependencies for API and training
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic==2.8.2 anyio pytest httpx pandas numpy scipy scikit-learn lightgbm

# NLP dependencies for FinBERT sentiment analysis
pip install transformers torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys:
# ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY=your_key_here
# NEWS_API_KEY=your_key_here
# FMP_API_KEY=your_key_here
# 
# Optional Redis configuration:
# REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
#
# Optional external price model configuration:
# USE_REMOTE_PRICE_MODEL=false
# PRICE_MODEL_URL=http://localhost:9000/predict
```

### Training the Meta-Learner

Train the LightGBM meta-learner model:
```bash
python libs/models/train_meta.py --symbol AAPL --start 2022-01-01 --end 2024-12-31 --horizon 5 --outfile models/meta_lgbm.pkl
```

### Running the System

#### Option A: Direct Python (Development)
```bash
# Start the orchestrator
uvicorn apps.orchestrator.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Option B: Docker (Production-like)
```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# The orchestrator will be available at http://localhost:8000
```

#### Option C: Using Makefile (Recommended for Development)
```bash
# Start services with single command (Redis + orchestrator)
make up

# Stop services
make down
```

Additional make commands:
- `make test` - Run the test suite
- `make train` - Train the meta-learner model
- `make backtest` - Run backtesting
- `make price-model` - Start the external price model server

### Testing the API

Once running, test the API endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/analyze/AAPL?horizon_days=5
```

Expected response structure:
```json
{
  "decision": {
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "as_of": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "signal": "buy",
    "prob_up": 0.62,
    "uncertainty": 0.15,
    "size": 0.24
  },
  "agents": {
    "technical": {...},
    "fundamental": {...},
    "sentiment": {...},
    "forecast": {...}
  }
}
```

### Backtesting

Run a backtest:
```bash
python backtester/engine.py --symbol AAPL --start 2022-01-01 --end 2024-12-31 --horizon 5
```

## How the System Works

### Data Flow
1. **Inputs**: Market data (OHLCV) from Alpha Vantage, News from NewsAPI, Fundamentals from FMP
2. **Feature Engineering**: Technical indicators (RSI/MACD/Bollinger), Fundamental metrics with recency checks, Sentiment analysis with FinBERT
3. **Agents**: Technical, Fundamental, Sentiment, and Price Model agents process features independently
4. **Ensemble**: Meta-learner combines agent outputs using either trained LightGBM model or simple weighted baseline
5. **Orchestrator**: Coordinates the end-to-end pipeline with caching and logging

### Enhanced Fundamentals via FMP
- Pulls company profile, key metrics, and financial statements snapshot
- Converts to standardized FundamentalFeatures with recency_days tracking
- Includes profit margins and revenue growth signals
- Provides graceful fallback when API key is not set

### Sentiment Analysis
- Uses FinBERT (ProsusAI/finbert) from Hugging Face
- Processes news articles in batches for efficiency
- Applies time-decay weighting (newer news weighs more)
- Converts sentiment logits to scores in [-1,1] range

### HTTP Utilities
- Robust HTTP client with retry/backoff functionality
- Rate-limit handling for all API calls (429 responses)
- Shared async get_json helper across all data adapters
- Configurable timeout and retry parameters

### Meta-Learner
- **Training**: Builds dataset with agent outputs as features and realized forward returns as labels
- **Model**: LightGBM classifier predicts probability that forward return > 0
- **Inference**: Automatically uses trained model if available, otherwise falls back to weighted baseline

### Price Model Server (Optional)
- FastAPI service endpoint for external price models
- Ready to be replaced with trained TFT/LSTM models
- Orchestrator can route to it via configuration flag

## Configuration

The system uses a hierarchical configuration approach:
- **Environment variables** for deployment-specific settings
- **YAML configuration files** for application behavior
- **Model configuration** stored in MLflow

## Data Sources

Supported data sources include:
- **Alpha Vantage** - Real-time and historical market data with rate-limit handling
- **NewsAPI** - News articles for sentiment analysis with retry mechanism
- **Financial Modeling Prep** - Fundamental data with recency checks

## Model Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion** - Real-time data collection with robust HTTP handling
2. **Feature Engineering** - Technical indicators, fundamental metrics, and sentiment features
3. **Agent Processing** - Independent analysis by specialized agents
4. **Ensemble Learning** - Meta-learner combines agent signals
5. **Model Training** - LightGBM classifier with historical data
6. **Model Serving** - RESTful API endpoints for predictions
7. **Strategy Execution** - Automated trading based on model outputs
8. **Performance Tracking** - Real-time monitoring and alerting
